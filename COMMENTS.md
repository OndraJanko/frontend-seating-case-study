Documentation, comments and other information about the project

## User Auth

I chose local storage for user sessions to keep the project simple and focused on frontend development, avoiding unnecessary backend complexity.

## API Calls

I used Axios to make API calls to the backend and utilized Zod to validate the data sent to the backend.

## Seat Map

I used the useZoom hook from the @/hooks/useZoom.ts file to manage the zoom level of the seat map. The handleZoomIn, handleZoomOut, and handleResetZoom functions update the zoom level based on user interactions with the seat map.
